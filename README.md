Darwin is an open source **Artificial Intelligence Framework for CyberSecurity**. It can be compiled and run on **both FreeBSD and Linux**.

**Darwin will be available on this repository in the near future.**

We provide packages and support for FreeBSD.

Darwin is:
 - A multi-threaded C++ engine that runs **security filters** that work together to improve your network security
 - A collection of **agents** that use the DARWIN protocol to query the security filters accordingly

Darwin is still in an alpha stage, so few filters are available at this time.

Using the provided documentation and SDK you can develop your own Darwin Filters.

We are seeking help! Testers and volunteers are welcome!
